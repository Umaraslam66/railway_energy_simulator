```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Run simulations for both electric and diesel trains
2. Perform ML analysis
3. Generate visualizations
4. Save results in the `output` directory

## Example Output

The simulator generates several outputs:
- Energy consumption profiles
- Speed vs. efficiency analysis
- Comparative analysis between train types
- Optimization recommendations
